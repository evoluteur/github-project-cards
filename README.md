# GitHub-Projects-Cards

This project is a simple web page to fetch and display GitHub projects as cards.

Check out the [live demo](https://evoluteur.github.io/github-projects-cards) and the [raw data](https://api.github.com/users/evoluteur/repos) from GitHub API.

Just change the username (at the top of the "/js/repo.js" file) to display your projects...

For each project the card shows the project name, stars, forks, descriptions, language, creation date, and last update, as well as links to the GitHub repo, demo, and star history.
